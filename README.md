Salutations, I am Doug Langstraat @dougolang

I’m currently learning C / Python / SQL / JavaScript / HTML / CSS / git / Linux.

I recently completed CS50 Harvard's Intro to Programming
I also recently completed teh Consensys Acadamie's Blockchain Foundations course as I am 
interested in the blockchain space.
I am pivoting my career into software development. I am only a beginner but very excited
to learn more. I have already learned a great deal!

I would like to support open source projects related to web 3.0 and trustless transaction protocols.
